# Rook_polynomial
This is a pytthon code to calculate the rook polynomial of a certain problem.
First we have to enter a matrix size, and enter the matrix elements in 0s and 1s,
The 1s mean that the block is shaded 
For example:
First line of output will be to enter a row
We have to enter the matrix size 
then we have to enter the elemnts of each rows
1 incidating its shaded, 0 indicating it is not shaded.
